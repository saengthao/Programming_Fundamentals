        <h2>Lab 09: Arrays</h2>

        <h4>File: unit6/labs/lab09arrays.html</h4>

        <h3>Student Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Name: Rashen Thao</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate place.</li>
          <li>Read the problem statement.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Nouns and Verbs" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Defining Diagram" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Checking the Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Now open the file <strong>unit6/labs/js/lab09arrays.js </strong>in Notepad++</li>
          <li>In that JavaScript file, write a JavaScript program in the function <strong>lab09arrays</strong> that addresses the problem statement.
            <ol>
              <li>Your output should look like the <strong>Example Output</strong> at the bottom of the lab.</li>
              <li>Remember to follow all coding standards and add appropriate comments!</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Test everything. How many test plans do you need to completely test this?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Lab Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong><em>Write a program that asks for student usernames. Collect student usernames until the user enters &quot;done&quot;. Once all the data has been gathered, the program should display the total number of records you collected. It should then convert the usernames to student email addresses (by appending @student.cvtc.edu&quot;) and display the converted addresses in a list as shown in the example output.</em></strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You'll use both FOR and WHILE loops in this problem, as well as an IF statement. You'll use an <strong>array</strong> to store the usernames.</p>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the above problem statement and paste it below so it appears in the black box when you refresh the page, underneath the words <code class="varname">PROBLEM STATEMENT</code>.</li>
          <li>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and write them in the appropriate locations so they appear in the black box below when you refresh the page.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a program that asks for student usernames. Collect student usernames
until the user enters "done". Once all the data has been gathered, the program should display
the total number of records you collected. It should then convert the usernames to student
email addresses (by appending @student.cvtc.edu") and display the converted addresses in a list
as shown in the example output.

Nouns: Usernames, Email addresses, Records, List

Verbs: Write, Ask, Collect, Enter, Display, Convert, Append
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</li>
          <li>Make your variable names <strong>valid JavaScript names</strong> that conform to the course JavaScript Coding Standards.</li>
          <li>Write down the processes with very short statements, 2 or 3 words. Remember, this is not pseudocode. This is just the process.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  usernames

PROCESSING:
  Initialize array to usernames
  Use WHILE loop
  Prompt user to enter usernames
  If usernames is entered, append to array
  Calculate the total number of usernames entered
  If enter done, end loop
  Use FOR loop
  convert usernames to email address
  
OUTPUTS:
  Display usernames collected
</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a solution algorithm (using Pseudocode) based on the defining diagram. Remember to give your algorithm a name and use proper indentation.</li>
          <li>Ensure you include an appropriate level of detail for your input, processing, and output logic.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
collectStudentUsernames
  initialize usernames to array
  
  WHILE true
    prompt user for usernames
    if user enter usernames, add to array
    if enter "done", end the loop
  END WHILE

  FOR total number of usernames in array
  append @student.cvtc.edu to usernames
  
  output each usernames
END
</pre>

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a test plan for the algorithm.
            <ul>
              <li>Don't forget to fill in the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section! That's easy to miss!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Have <b>at least 3 test cases</b> that test different inputs and outputs. </li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">

        <h3>5. JavaScript Program</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done.</li>
          <li>You will need to follow the coding standards for the course.</li>
          <li>Once everything is working, go back and <strong>fill in</strong> the actual results sections in the test plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example Output</h3>

<pre class="output">
You entered 3 usernames. Here are the email addresses:

homer@student.cvtc.edu
bart@student.cvtc.edu
marge@student.cvtc.edu
</pre>

        <h3>Your Output:</h3>

<pre class="output">
<script src="js/lab09arrays.js"></script>
</pre>

        <h2>What You Did</h2>
        <p>You combined arrays, IF statements, counted, and uncounted loops to solve a more complex problem.</p>
